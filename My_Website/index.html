            <p>Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Ohio in the United States. 
            He started school at the age of eight but he hated it because on his first day the teacher called him stupid. After that, he stayed at home a lot of the time and had lessons from his mother.
            He also read a lot of science books at home. He went back to school sometimes but he never liked it very much. He left school forever at the age of twelve and got a job with a newsagent. 
            He began inventing things at the age of nineteen. In 1877 he invented the phonograph, a sort of very early CD player! Two years later, he made the world's first electric Light bulb and 
            New York became the first city to have electric lights.</p>
